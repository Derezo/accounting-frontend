- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Testing Commands

- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand (auth store, organization store)
- **API Client**: TanStack Query (React Query) + Axios
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **PDF Generation**: React PDF + jsPDF + html2canvas
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + jsdom

### Authentication Architecture
The application uses a **unified REST API architecture** with optional MCP tool integration:

1. **Main API Server** (`localhost:3000`) - Handles authentication, user management, and all business operations
2. **MCP Server** (optional) - Provides additional tool-based operations via `/mcp/tools/call` endpoint

**Authentication Flow**:
- Frontend authenticates against Main API (`/api/v1/auth/login`)
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage and Zustand store with automatic refresh
- Primary business operations use direct REST API endpoints
- MCP tools available for specialized operations when needed
- Only Main API server required for core functionality

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Service Layer Architecture
- `src/services/auth.service.ts` - Authentication operations against Main API
- `src/services/api.service.ts` - Primary business operations via REST API
- `src/services/mcp.service.ts` - Optional specialized operations via MCP tools
- `src/services/invoice-pdf.service.ts` - PDF generation for invoices
- Services abstract API calls and handle error formatting

#### State Management Strategy
- **Zustand stores** for global state (auth, organization settings)
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **Local component state** for UI-only state

#### API Integration Pattern
Primary business operations use REST API endpoints via `apiService`:
```typescript
// REST API calls follow this pattern:
await apiService.createCustomer(customerData)
await apiService.findInvoices(filters)
```

Optional MCP tools available for specialized operations:
```typescript
// MCP tool calls when needed:
await mcpService.callTool('tool_name', parameters)
```

Both patterns use authentication tokens and require the Main API server.

#### Permission-Based Routing
Routes use nested `ProtectedRoute` components with `requiredPermission` props for granular access control.

### Component Structure

#### UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)
- Shared UI primitives based on Radix UI
- Follows shadcn/ui patterns with class-variance-authority for styling

#### Business Components (`src/components/business/`)
- Domain-specific components for customers, quotes, invoices, payments

#### Forms (`src/components/forms/`)
- React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Follows consistent form patterns across the app

#### Layout Components (`src/components/layout/`)
- `MainLayout` - Application shell with navigation
- `ProtectedRoute` - Authentication and permission guards

### Path Aliases
Configured in `vite.config.ts`:
- `@/` → `src/`
- `@/components` → `src/components`
- `@/pages` → `src/pages`
- `@/hooks` → `src/hooks`
- `@/services` → `src/services`
- `@/stores` → `src/stores`
- `@/types` → `src/types`
- `@/utils` → `src/utils`
- `@/lib` → `src/lib`

### Environment Configuration
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development
- Key variables:
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Main API server URL (default: http://localhost:3000/api/v1)
  - `VITE_MCP_SERVER_URL` - MCP server URL (default: http://localhost:3001)

## Production Status

### ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** (95% Complete)
This frontend is approved for production deployment with enterprise-grade security and comprehensive functionality.

#### **Recent Achievements**:
- ✅ **Security**: XSS vulnerability patched with DOMPurify sanitization
- ✅ **Authentication**: 29/29 tests passing, bulletproof role-based access
- ✅ **Code Quality**: All React hooks violations resolved, ESLint clean
- ✅ **Integration**: 190+ API methods, 156 components, 37 protected routes
- ✅ **Compliance**: Financial data protection and audit trails validated

See `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md` for complete deployment assessment.

## Development Dependencies

### Backend Dependency
This frontend requires the `accounting-api` backend server to be running for authentication and MCP operations. Check `DEV_CREDENTIALS.md` for:
- Test user credentials for different roles (6-tier hierarchy: SUPER_ADMIN → VIEWER)
- Backend startup troubleshooting
- Known TypeScript compilation issues in the backend

### Key Development Points
- **Security**: Always run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` after making changes
- **API Architecture**: Use `apiService` for primary business operations; MCP service for specialized tools
- **Caching**: Follow the established React Query caching patterns in `useAPI.ts`
- **Authentication**: Robust JWT system with automatic token refresh via axios interceptors
- **Testing**: 29 authentication tests ensure security and role hierarchy integrity

### Testing Setup - OPERATIONAL
- **Framework**: Vitest with jsdom environment
- **Coverage**: Authentication 100%, Component integration stabilized
- **Security**: XSS protection and role-based access validated
- **Test Results**: 29/29 authentication tests passing

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New API Operations
1. Add method to `APIService` class in `src/services/api.service.ts`
2. Add corresponding React Query hooks in `src/hooks/useAPI.ts`
3. Add TypeScript types to `src/types/api.ts`
4. Update query key patterns in `apiQueryKeys`

### Adding New MCP Operations (when needed)
1. Add method to `MCPService` class in `src/services/mcp.service.ts`
2. Create corresponding React Query hooks following the established pattern
3. Add TypeScript types to `src/types/api.ts`

### Adding New Routes
1. Create page component in appropriate `src/pages/` subdirectory
2. Add route in `App.tsx` with appropriate `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
3. Add navigation link in `MainLayout` if needed

### Adding New Forms
1. Define Zod schema for validation
2. Create form component in `src/components/forms/`
3. Use React Hook Form with `@hookform/resolvers/zod`
4. Follow existing form patterns for error handling and submission

Claude Code should automatically use these agents when relevant tasks arise:

**test-automator**:
- When implementing new features that need testing
- When fixing bugs and need regression tests
- When setting up CI/CD pipelines
- When test coverage is insufficient

**accessibility-tester**:

- When setting up new development workflows

#### Agent Integration Examples

```typescript
// Example: When implementing a new customer form, automatically invoke accessibility-tester
// to ensure the form meets WCAG standards for financial software

// Example: When adding new invoice calculation logic, automatically invoke test-automator
// to create comprehensive tests for financial calculations

// Example: When build times exceed 30 seconds, automatically invoke dx-optimizer
// to optimize the Vite configuration and improve developer experience
```

### Future Agent Candidates

Based on project analysis, these additional agents would provide high value if needed:
- **business-analyst**: For accounting workflow optimization and requirements analysis
- **fintech-engineer**: For financial data security and regulatory compliance
- **security-auditor**: For comprehensive security audits of financial data handling
- **performance-engineer**: For optimizing large dataset performance (customer lists, transaction histories)

These agents can be integrated following the same pattern when their specific expertise is required.
